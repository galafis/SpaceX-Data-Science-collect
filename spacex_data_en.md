# Data Collected - SpaceX Falcon 9 & Heavy Launches (English)

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches (Accessed May 2, 2025)

## Overview

*   As of 29 April 2025, rockets from the Falcon 9 family have been launched 478 times, with 475 full mission successes, three failures, and one partial failure.
*   Designed and operated by SpaceX, the Falcon 9 family includes the retired versions Falcon 9 v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2 "Full Thrust" (blocks 1–4), along with the active Block 5 evolution.
*   Falcon Heavy is a heavy-lift derivative of Falcon 9, combining a strengthened central core with two Falcon 9 first stages as side boosters.

## Reusability

*   The Falcon design features reusable first-stage boosters, which land either on a ground pad near the launch site or on a drone ship at sea.
*   In December 2015, Falcon 9 became the first rocket to land propulsively after delivering a payload into orbit.
*   Reusability results in significantly reduced launch costs.
*   Falcon family boosters have successfully landed 438 times in 451 attempts.
*   A total of 46 boosters have flown multiple missions, with a record of 27 missions by a booster.
*   SpaceX has also reflown fairing halves more than 300 times, with some being reflown at least twenty times.

## Typical Missions & Payloads

*   Launches of SpaceX's Starlink satellites (majority of manifest since Jan 2020).
*   Dragon crew and cargo missions to the International Space Station (ISS).
*   Launches of commercial and military satellites to LEO, polar, and geosynchronous orbits.
*   Heaviest payload launched on Falcon: batch of 24 Starlink V2-Mini satellites weighing about 17,500 kg (38,600 lb) total (first flown Feb 2024).
*   Heaviest payload launched to GTO: 9,200 kg (20,300 lb) Jupiter-3 (July 29, 2023).
*   Launches to higher orbits: DSCOVR (Sun–Earth L1), TESS (lunar flyby), Tesla Roadster demo (heliocentric orbit past Mars), DART and Hera (asteroid Didymos), Euclid (Sun-Earth L2), Psyche (asteroid 16 Psyche), and Europa Clipper (Jupiter's moon Europa).

## Launch Statistics Summary

*   Overall success rate: 99.37% (as of May 2025, based on 475 successes in 478 launches).
*   In-flight failures: SpaceX CRS-7, Starlink Group 9-3.
*   Pre-flight failure: AMOS-6 (on-pad static fire test).
*   Partial failure: SpaceX CRS-1 (secondary payload stranded in lower orbit).
*   Active version (Falcon 9 Block 5): Flown 410 times successfully, failed once (Starlink Group 9-3), resulting in a 99.76% success rate.
*   Launch records: In 2022, Falcon 9 set a record with 60 successful launches in a calendar year. In 2024, SpaceX broke their own record with 134 total Falcon flights (133 successful).

## Evolution

*   Falcon 9 v1.0: Launched 5 times (2010-2013).
*   Falcon 9 v1.1: Launched 15 times (2013-2016).
*   Falcon 9 Full Thrust: Launched 36 times (2015-2018).
*   Falcon 9 Block 5: Introduced May 2018. Most recent version, more powerful, capable of vertical landing, focus on streamlining refurbishment for faster and more cost-effective re-flights.

## Falcon Heavy

*   Heavy-lift launch vehicle composed of three Falcon 9 first-stage boosters.
*   Central core is reinforced, side boosters feature aerodynamic nosecones instead of the usual interstage.

## Booster Landing Statistics

*   Falcon 9 first-stage boosters landed successfully in 438 of 451 attempts (97.1%).
*   Falcon 9 Block 5 version landing success: 413 out of 419 attempts (98.6%).
*   Total successful second stage launches: 411 (all but one payload successfully launched).
